abstract = {This paper addresses our proposed method to automatically segment$\backslash$nout a person's face from a given image that consists of a$\backslash$nhead-and-shoulders view of the person and a complex background scene.$\backslash$nThe method involves a fast, reliable, and effective algorithm that$\backslash$nexploits the spatial distribution characteristics of human skin color. A$\backslash$nuniversal skin-color map is derived and used on the chrominance$\backslash$ncomponent of the input image to detect pixels with skin-color$\backslash$nappearance. Then, based on the spatial distribution of the detected$\backslash$nskin-color pixels and their corresponding luminance values, the$\backslash$nalgorithm employs a set of novel regularization processes to reinforce$\backslash$nregions of skin-color pixels that are more likely to belong to the$\backslash$nfacial regions and eliminate those that are not. The performance of the$\backslash$nface-segmentation algorithm is illustrated by some simulation results$\backslash$ncarried out on various head-and-shoulders test images. The use of face$\backslash$nsegmentation for video coding in applications such as videotelephony is$\backslash$nthen presented. We explain how the face-segmentation results can be used$\backslash$nto improve the perceptual quality of a videophone sequence encoded by$\backslash$nthe H.261-compliant coder},
